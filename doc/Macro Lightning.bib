abstract = {The experiment made with the Baksan air shower array discovered two types of pre-lightning enhancements of the soft component of cosmic rays. We present the preliminary results of an experiment in which the distance to lightning events associated with such enhancements is estimated acoustically using a simple microphone system. During observations in the autumn of 2002, we have succeeded in finding some events, for which it was possible to measure minimum distances to lightning channels. These distances turned out to be fairly large.},

abstract = {IN order to explain the curious behaviour of lightning flashes the possibility should be kept in mind of a connexion between a lightning discharge and the cosmic rays. When penetrating particles from cosmic rays move through the atmosphere{\textemdash}in this case through electrically loaded clouds{\textemdash}they are ionising the air, making conducting paths for the lightning. The twisted or irregular shapes of lightning flashes may find a natural explanation, if we think of a discharge path following the variable network of ion-tracks, such as are assumed to be present in the air at any moment, caused by nuclear disintegration of atoms and other processes in conjunction with the cosmic rays, causing emission of protons, neutrons and negative or positive electrons.},

abstract = {The entirety of the Earth's climate system is continuously bombarded by cosmic rays and exhibits about 2000 thunderstorms active at any time of the day all over the globe. Any linkage among these vast systems should have global consequences. Numerous studies done in the past deal with partial links between some selected aspects of this grand linkage. Results of these studies vary from weakly to strongly significant and are not yet complete enough to justify the physical mechanism proposed to explain such links. This review is aimed at presenting the current understanding, based on the past studies on the link between cosmic ray, lightning and climate. The deficiencies in some proposed links are pointed out. Impacts of cosmic rays on engineering systems and the possible effects of cosmic rays on human health are also briefly discussed. Also enumerated are some problems for future work which may help in developing the grand linkage among these three vast systems.},
