Constraints from Macro-Induced Lightning
========================================

Welcome to ``macro_lightning``, the code-base for a paper on constraining macroscopic dark matter models with observations of lightning on Earth and Jupiter. If you are looking for the paper, the peer-reviewed journal article will be `linked here <https://journals.aps.org/prd/>`_ and the `arXiv preprint here <https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16272>`_. Alternatively, the source code for the paper is included as a sub-module in the folder "docs/papers_and_presentations/paper".

Macroscopic dark matter (macros) is a broad class of alternative candidates to particle dark matter. These candidates would transfer energy to matter primarily through elastic scattering. A sufficiently large macro passing through the atmosphere would produce a straight channel of ionized plasma. If the cross-section of the macro is ``\sigma_x \gtrapprox 6 \times 10^{-9} \rm{cm}^2``, then under atmospheric conditions conducive to lightning (eg. a thunderstorm) the plasma channel would be sufficient to seed a lightning strike with a single leader.

This is entirely unlike ordinary bolt lightning in which a long sequence of hundreds or thousands of few-meter-long leaders are strung together. This macro-induced lightning would be extremely straight, and thus highly distinctive. Neither wind shear nor magnetohydrodynamic instabilities would markedly spoil its straightness. The only photographically documented case of a straight lightning bolt is probably not straight enough to have been macro-induced.

For any discussion or derivations, see the paper. For code documentation, see `ReadTheDocs <https://github.com/cwru-pat/macro_lightning>`_. This is the raw code.

Notebooks
---------

Folder contains Mathematica notebooks to compute event rates for macro-induced lightning, as well as the constraints in mass and cross-section, both for lightning events on Earth and on Jupiter. There is also a notebook to compute the fraction of the Maxwell distribution of DM particles with velocities high enough to produce straight lightning bolts (ie. traveling faster than a lightning leader would ordinarily propagate).

Further notebooks can be found in "docs/examples"
